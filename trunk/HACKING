Rules for editing the source code
	(or "Why do you refuse my paches?")


1)   CheetahBB obeys the PHP coding standard rules #01-#21 and the Suggestions #2-#3
	(see http://php-coding-standard.de/mhtml/table_of_content.html)
1.1) The description of a file, a class or a function must not be longer than 100 chars per line.
	If the description is longer, please add a newline.
2)   Every modification has to be mentioned in the CHANGELOG with the date and the name of the
	editor.
