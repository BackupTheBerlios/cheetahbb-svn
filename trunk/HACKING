Rules for editing the source code
	(or "Why do you refuse my paches?")


1)    CheetahBB obeys the PHP coding standard rules #01-#21 and the Suggestions #2-#4 (see http://php-coding-standard.de/mhtml/table_of_content.html)
1.1)  /* ... */ is reserved for text comments. To comment out code use if(0)
1.2)  If your comment is longer than 100 chars (including whitespace in front of the comment) add a newline.
1.3)  You must not use the ternary conditional operator ($first ? $second : $third) because it makes code so confusing.
2)    Every modification has to be mentioned in the CHANGELOG with the date and the name of the editor.
2.1)  If it took you more than one day to code something, use the day when you finished your changes.
3)    If you create a new file, don't forget to add the svn:keywords-keyword Date:
	svn propset svn:keywords Date <Your File>
